# Slack Local Menu
A simple message sending bot to determine the current menu at [Tiffin Time](https://www.tiffintime.co.uk/). It pulls text and image description, formats message then sends into our slack team.

Utilises the Web API using a bot token, so that the timestamp can be obtained from the posted message, and therefore reactions can be added to the initial message.
